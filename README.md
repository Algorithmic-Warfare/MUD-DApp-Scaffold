# MUD: Minehaul System for Coordinated SSU-aided Operations

This directory contains the implementation and resources for the **Minehaul System**, inspired by the concepts described in [Minehaul System, A Platform for Coordinated SSU-aided Operations](https://symplectic.link/Minehaul+System%2C+A+Platform+for+Coordinated+SSU-aided+Operations).

## Overview

The Minehaul System is designed as a platform to coordinate Semi-Sentient Units (SSUs) in complex, multi-agent environments. The system leverages algorithmic strategies for resource allocation, task assignment, and dynamic adaptation, as outlined in the referenced article.

## Folder Structure

- **/src/**: Core source code for the MUD (Multi-User Domain) simulation and SSU coordination logic.
- **/assets/**: Supporting assets such as configuration files, maps, and scenario data.
- **/docs/**: Additional documentation and technical references.
- **/tests/**: Test cases and validation scripts for system components.

## Key Features

- **SSU Coordination**: Implements distributed algorithms for SSU collaboration and task execution.
- **Dynamic Resource Management**: Adapts to changing environments and resource availability.
- **Scenario Simulation**: Supports customizable scenarios for testing coordinated operations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `MUD` directory.
2. Review the `/src/` folder for main entry points and system logic.
3. Refer to `/docs/` for detailed design and usage instructions.
