## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Linux or WSL
- Node.js v18+
- pnpm
- Foundry
- Docker

### Environment Setup (easy)

1. Install Ansible, following [the following installation steps](https://www.linuxtechi.com/how-to-install-ansible-on-ubuntu/)
2. Clone the dev box setup script
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Algorithmic-Warfare/frontier-dev-box-setup
```
3. Run the script following instructions in `./frontier-dev-box-setup/README.md`.


### Environment Setup (manual)

Follow the steps describe here, [setting up tools](https://docs.evefrontier.com/Tools) and here, [setting up the world](https://docs.evefrontier.com/LocalWorldSetup).

###  Testing

1. Fork the repository then clone the fork locally.
2. Follow the [GETTING STARTED](#getting-started) section and make sure everything works.
3. Make a new branch and call it `exp` (DO NOT WORK in the `main` branch)
4. If you detect an issue or have a suggestion, first read [HOW TO ISSUE](./.testerdocs/HOW%20TO%20ISSUE.md) and structure your feedback accordingly at [Scaffold Issues](https://github.com/Algorithmic-Warfare/MUD-DApp-Scaffold/issues).

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development Workflows

#### Getting Started Commands
```bash
# Starts an eveworld v2 on a local node @ http://localhost:8586
pnpm world:up 

# Initiate an mprocs that,
# - Forks the world node above into http://localhost:8584
# - Deploys the systems defined in the `contracts` package in watch mode.
# - Start the client @ http://localhost:3000 in watch mode
# - Runs system tests defined in `contracts` (requires the contract deployement to resolve first). Process will fail initially but after contract deployement, press "R", to rerun them.
pnpm dev
```

## System Architecture
### Frontend Structure

#### Client Application

A React-based client for interacting with MUD systems, built with Vite and TypeScript, featuring MUD integration for state management and blockchain operations.


##### Requirements

Get setup using, [Frontier devbox Ansible setup script](https://github.com/Algorithmic-Warfare/frontier-dev-box-setup), to get your fresh Ubuntu envrionment ready for development in one-command run.

##### Dependencies

Install NPM packages,
```bash
cd packages/contracts
pnpm install
```

##### Variables

Create `.env` file from `.envsample`:
```bash
cp .envsample .env
```

Currently, the required variables are `VITE_CHAIN_ID` and `VITE_WORLD_ADDRESS`.

**Example `.env` for local**
```sh
VITE_CHAIN_ID=31337
VITE_WORLD_ADDRESS=0x0165878a594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242eb8f

```

**Example `.env` for pyrope**
```sh
VITE_CHAIN_ID=695569
VITE_WORLD_ADDRESS= # INSERT Current world address ...

```

### Contract Structure

#### Contracts Package

A repository of Solidity written smart contracts defining systems, tables and namespaces within the MUD framework.

This package is based on the structure generated by MUD default template.


##### Requirements

Get setup using, [Frontier devbox Ansible setup script](https://github.com/Algorithmic-Warfare/frontier-dev-box-setup), to get your fresh Ubuntu envrionment ready for development in one-command run.

##### Dependencies

Install NPM packages,
```bash
cd packages/contracts
pnpm install
```

##### Variables

Create `.env` file from `.envsample`:
```bash
cd packages/contracts
cp .envsample .env
```

The following environment variables are used to configure the `contracts` package:

-   `WORLD_ADDRESS`(*): The address of the MUD World contract.
-   `CHAIN_ID`(*): The ID of the Ethereum chain.
-   `PRIVATE_KEY`(*): The private key of the deployer account.
-   `RPC_URL`(*): The URL of the Ethereum RPC endpoint.

NOTE: Variables marked by (*) are *REQUIRED* to be set.

**Example `.env` for local**
```sh
DEBUG=mud:*

WORLD_ADDRESS=0x0165878a594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242eb8f # AUTO world deployer address
CHAIN_ID=31337
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 # DEFAULT Anvil account
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545

```

**Example `.env` for pyrope**
```sh
DEBUG=mud:*

WORLD_ADDRESS= # INSERT Current world address ...
CHAIN_ID=695569
PRIVATE_KEY= # INSERT Your private key ...
RPC_URL=https://pyrope-external-sync-node-rpc.live.tech.evefrontier.com

```

##### Scripts

-   `build`: Builds the contracts using `mud build`.
-   `clean`: Cleans the build artifacts and autogenerated code.
-   `deploy:local`: Deploys the contracts to a local development network.
-   `deploy:pyrope`: Deploys the contracts to the Pyrope testnet.
-   `test`: Runs the tests using Forge.
-   `coverage`: Generates code coverage reports.
